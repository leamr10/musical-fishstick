# Module 12 Challenge

This challenge was designed for us to use Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL to create an employee tracker
where companies can view, add and update employees, roles and departments. I was able to do this by 
creating the tables and rows inside the schema file and seeding the database with the values I wanted
in the table with the seeds file in MySQL. Then I created the functions needed to respond to each query 
that would be made inside the terminal. 

The queries and functions were the most difficult part of this assignment just because it can get easy
to become disorganized with the responses after the input prompts. However, slowing down and making sure
I was putting everything where it needed to be got me to the end goal of the challenge.
